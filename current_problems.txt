For some reason, in Auth my import 
{ useSignInWithGoogle } from 'react-firebase-hooks/auth'
isn't registering, even though react-firebase-hooks was installed

My shop from flask week isn't hosted on render, so I'm not able to make 
API calls currently; when trying to build on render, the following error
occurs: 

ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement 
dnspython==2.4.2 (from -r requirements.txt (line 9)) 
(from versions: 1.11.0, 1.11.1, 1.12.0, 1.13.0, 1.14.0, 1.15.0, 1.16.0, 
2.0.0rc1, 2.0.0rc2, 2.0.0, 2.1.0rc1, 2.1.0, 2.2.0rc1, 2.2.0, 2.2.1, 
2.3.0rc1, 2.3.0)
Sep 26 08:03:02 PM  ERROR: No matching distribution found for 
dnspython==2.4.2 (from -r requirements.txt (line 9))

I'm not exactly sure why this is happening if I was grabbing directly
from my requirements.  Do I just need to change the dnspython requirement
in requirements.txt to be something that is available to render?
